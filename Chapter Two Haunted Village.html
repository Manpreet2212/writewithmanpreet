The next morning, Harry and his friends woke up to find that something was not right. The once beautifully decorated house now seemed old and abandoned, as if no one had lived there for years. The friends started to feel uneasy.  
John: “Guys, do you feel that too? It’s like someone’s watching us.”  
Charles: “Yeah, and it’s getting cold in here.”  
Shabina: “Let’s get out of here. I don’t want to stay in this creepy house anymore.”  
But just as they were about to leave, they heard a loud banging sound from the door. Harry, being the bravest of them all, decided to go and check.  
Harry: “Who’s there?”  
No one answered. Harry slowly opened the door and saw nothing but the darkness outside.  
Harry: “Guys, it’s just the wind. Let’s not worry about it.”  
But the banging sound continued, and the friends could feel a presence in the house.  
Rohan: “I don’t think this is just the wind, Harry. I feel like we’re not alone in here.”  
Suddenly, the lights went out, and the friends were left in complete darkness.  
John: “What the hell is going on? Someone turn on the lights!”  
But as they tried to find their way around the dark house, they heard footsteps coming towards them.  
Shabina: “Harry, please tell me this is just a joke.”  
Harry: “I wish it was, Shabina. Let’s stick together and find a way out of here.”  
As they tried to make their way out, they heard whispers in the darkness.  
Voice: “Get out of my house.”  
The friends screamed and ran towards the door, but it was locked from the outside.  
Charles: “We’re trapped!”  
The voice continued to whisper, and the friends could feel a cold breeze blowing through the house.  
Voice: “You should have never come here. This is a graveyard, and you have disturbed the spirits.”  
The friends huddled together, trembling with fear, as they realized that they were trapped in a haunted house.  
Harry: “We have to find a way out of here. We can’t stay here any longer.”  
The friends tried to find a way out, but they were surrounded by the darkness and the whispers of the spirits.  
As they huddled together, praying for their safety, they realized that they were not alone in the house. The spirits of the dead had risen, and they were not happy about being disturbed.  
The friends screamed in terror as they were consumed by the darkness and the horrors that lurked within the haunted house of Kheri Rao Wali.
