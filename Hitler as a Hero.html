  <div class="creation-content">
On a Sunny day he awoke,  
destiny was waiting on the door to knock.  
and with his birth his parents had a hope,  
and they didn’t thought that he will cope.  
I don’t know if you are guessing it,  
Because in my Imagination It’s perfectly fit.  
I think you Guessed it right,  
with a cold and beautiful sigh.  
Adolf Hitler was his perfect name,  
Nazi Leaders hailed him in God’s name.  
He was the one who coped all of Europe,  
Yet in his conquest, there was hope.  
he was the one who defeated country's in seconds,  
But history Shows that his legacy beckons.  
Everyone thought that he will reign,  
but no one can feel his pain.  
History Portrayed him as villan,  
People thought that he is killin.  
no one beleived that he was a hero,  
His actions dark, they brought only sorrow.  
– Manpreet Singh
