  <div class="creation-content">
The friends huddled together, trembling with fear, as they realized that they were trapped in a haunted house.  
Harry: “We have to find a way out of here. We can’t stay here any longer.”  
The friends tried to find a way out, but they were surrounded by the darkness and the whispers of the spirits. Every step they took echoed through the empty corridors, adding to their growing sense of dread. Shadows danced on the walls, creating eerie shapes that seemed to taunt them.  
Rohan: “We need to stay calm and think. There must be a way out of this nightmare.”  
Shabina: “But how? The doors are locked, and the windows are barred. It feels like the house itself is keeping us captive.”  
John: “We can’t give up. Let’s search for any hidden passages or secret doors. There must be something we’re missing.”  
With renewed determination, they started to explore every nook and cranny of the house, hoping to stumble upon a hidden escape route. Their hearts pounded in their chests, and each creaking floorboard sent chills down their spines.  
As they delved deeper into the house, they discovered a dusty old library. The shelves were filled with ancient books, their pages yellowed with age. Harry pulled out a particularly large volume and blew off the dust, revealing a faded title, “The Secrets of Kheri Rao Wali.”  
Harry: “Maybe this book holds the key to our escape. Let’s see if there’s any mention of hidden passages or a way out.”  
They eagerly flipped through the pages, their eyes scanning the cryptic text and illustrations. Within the pages, they discovered a diagram of the house, showcasing hidden tunnels beneath the floorboards.  
Charles: “Look! There’s a hidden tunnel that leads to the basement. It might be our way out.”  
Rohan: “But how do we access it? The floor seems solid.”  
With a sudden realization, Shabina recalled a line from the book.  
Shabina: “It says here that the spirits guarding this house can be appeased with an offering of their favorite flower. It’s the only way to unlock the hidden passage.”  
Harry: “We need to find that flower and make an offering. Hurry!”  
The friends hurriedly searched the house, their hands trembling with anticipation. Finally, they stumbled upon a withered bouquet of roses, hidden away in a forgotten corner.  
Harry carefully plucked a single rose from the bouquet and placed it on the floor, following the instructions from the book. Suddenly, a section of the floorboards creaked open, revealing a narrow staircase leading down into the darkness.  
John: “This is it! Let’s go, everyone!”  
They descended into the underground passage, their hearts racing. The air grew heavy and musty as they ventured deeper into the labyrinth beneath the house. The whispers faded away, and the oppressive atmosphere lifted.  
After what felt like an eternity, they emerged from the darkness, finding themselves outside, under the open sky.  
Shabina: “We made it! We’re finally free.”  
Relief washed over them as they realized they had escaped the clutches of the haunted house. Though shaken and forever changed by the experience, they had survived the ordeal.  
As they walked away from the abandoned house of Kheri Rao Wali, they knew they would never forget the terrifying adventure they had faced together. And they vowed to share their story, warning others to stay away from the haunted house that held the tormented spirits of the past.
